# MySQL Database Interface

This project is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to connect to a MySQL database, execute SQL queries, and display the results. The application is built using Python's Tkinter library and the mysql-connector-python library.

## Features

- **Connect to MySQL Database**: Input database credentials to connect to your MySQL database.
- **Execute SQL Queries**: Enter any valid SQL query to be executed against the connected database.
- **Display Results**: Results of executed queries are displayed in a scrollable text area.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides user-friendly messages for any errors encountered during database operations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or later
- MySQL Server
- Required Python packages:
  - `mysql-connector-python`
  - `tkinter` (included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the project files):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd mysqlconnection
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python mysqlconnection.py
   ```

2. **Connect to the Database**:
   - Enter your MySQL server's `Host`, `Database`, `User`, and `Password`.
   - Click the **Connect** button.

3. **Execute SQL Queries**:
   - Enter your SQL query in the provided input field.
   - Click the **Execute** button to run the query.
   - Results will be displayed in the scrollable text area.

4. **Close the Application**:
   - Click the close button on the application window or use the **Close** option to terminate the application gracefully.

## Example SQL Queries

- Create a new table:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
      id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
      age INT
  );
  ```

- Insert data:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES ('John Doe', 30);
  ```

- Fetch data:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM users;
  ```
